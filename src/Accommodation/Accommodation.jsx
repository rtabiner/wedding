            Unfortunately due to the size of our wedding party, Castle Durrow is
            unable to accommodate everyone on the night of our wedding. We have
            set aside a number of rooms for our guests in the Castle Arms Hotel
            and Durrow House B+B. Both are less than a five minute walk from the
            venue. Rooms are held until 24th January. To book a room please use
            the contact details below and let them know that you belong to our
            wedding party.
