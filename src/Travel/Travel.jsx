                Dublin Airport is by far the largest airport, and has regular
                flights all year round from all major airports. Naturally we
                would reccommend booking well in advance to ensure the best
                fare, but generally speaking flights shouldn&apos;t cost much
                more than Â£50.

                Alternatively, you could fly to Cork which is a similar distance
                from Kilkenny as Dublin.

                Travelling by car is by far the easiset and quickest way to get
                around, and we would certainly recommend driving or hiring a car
                if this is an option.

                St. Canice&apos;s Church has plenty of room for parking, as do
                all of the recommended places to stay in the accomodation page.
                The distance between St. Canice&apos;s Church and the reception
                at Castle Durrow is about a 25 minute drive (26km / 16 miles).

                Unfortunately, Durrow is only a small village and is only
                supported by a local bus service, or by booking a taxi from
                Kilkenny.

                Unfortunately getting to Durrow via bus is not as
                straight-forward. You will need to get a bus to Portlaoise and
