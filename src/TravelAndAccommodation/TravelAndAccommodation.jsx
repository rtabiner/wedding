                Dublin Airport is by far the largest airport, and has regular flights all year round
                from all major airports. Naturally we would reccommend booking well in advance to
                ensure the best fare, but generally speaking flights shouldn&apos;t cost much more
                than Â£50.

                Alternatively, you could fly to Cork which is a similar distance from Kilkenny as
                Dublin.

                Travelling by car is by far the easiset and quickest way to get around, and we
                would certainly recommend driving or hiring a car if this is an option.

                St. Canice&apos;s Church has plenty of room for parking, as do all of the
                recommended places to stay in the accomodation page.
                The distance between St. Canice&apos;s Church and the reception at
                Castle Durrow is about a 25 minute drive (26km / 16 miles).

                It is possible to travel by train to Kilkenny from Heuston Station in Dublin.
                Trains run every few hours and can be booked

                Unfortunately, Durrow is only a small village and is only supported by
                a local bus service, or by booking a taxi from Kilkenny.
